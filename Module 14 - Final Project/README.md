<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">In this final project you will extend and enhance the functionality of the program you developed in Project 2 in module 13. You will create a menu-driven python console application that utilizes the project 2 database. The application will request user input and will use that user provided data to construct queries for your database. This program will perform each type of CRUD operation.</p>

</ol>
<h2>CRUD Operations</h2>
<p>The main menu of your program will present the user with options to read data, add data, delete data, and update data in the database.</p>
<h3>Read Data</h3>
<p>The following queries should query the views created in Project 2. <strong>When the user selects one of the following options they should then be asked to enter one of two inputs, if they want to view all data or specific data</strong>. For example, if the user selects option 1 from be low the will be prompted:</p>
<p>Enter region name for specific region or (All) to view all regions<strong>:</strong></p>
<p>The user can then enter a specific region to view data for that region only, or they can enter "All" to view data for all regions</p>
<ol>
<li>View employee count data per region.</li>
<li>View manager count by department</li>
<li>View dependent data per department</li>
<li>&nbsp;View hiring data by year</li>
<li>View Salary data by department</li>
<li>View Salary data by job title</li>
<li>View dependent data by employee</li>
<li>View location data by country</li>
</ol>

<h3>Add Data</h3>
<p>Your program should provide the user options to add and job or dependent. The program should prompt the user for all the necessary information to create those queries. The program should also let the user know if the query was successful or not.</p>
<h3>Delete Data</h3>
<p>Your program should provide the user options to delete and employee or dependent. The program should prompt the user for an employee id or dependent id for the delete query. The program should also let the user know if the query was successful or not.</p>
<h3>Update Data</h3>
<p>Your program should provide the user options to update an employees first name of last name, or to update a jobs minimum or maximum salary. The program should prompt the user for an employee id or job id and the updated values to create the query. The program should also let the user know if the query was successful or not.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start="109" data-line-end="110">What to Submit</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="111" data-line-end="112">You should submit a zip file named final_project_[pawprint].zip that contains your final project files: final_project_[pawprint].py and the SQL file with your view creations from Project 2 named final_project_[pawprint].sql</p></div></span></div></div>
